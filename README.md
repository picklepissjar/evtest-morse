# ev-morse
The code allows for the binding of multiple commands to a single key. (single, double, long press, ... any morse combination) <br>
Additionally there is a secondary function (run_hold) to repeat commands when being held down longer. <br>
Uses root privileges because it reads output from /dev/input. <br>
So be sure to read the code.
